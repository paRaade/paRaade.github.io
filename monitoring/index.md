# Security Monitoring and Penetration Testing Lab

This project involves the creation of an advanced cybersecurity lab environment designed to provide hands-on experience with various aspects of security monitoring, threat detection, and penetration testing. The lab integrates multiple tools and technologies to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios, including both offensive and defensive strategies.

### Tools Used:

- **Lubuntu (Operating System):** A lightweight Linux distribution used as the primary operating system in the lab environment.

- **Metasploitable (Vulnerable VM):** A purposely vulnerable virtual machine that serves as a target for penetration testing exercises, allowing for the exploration and exploitation of security weaknesses.

- **ELK Stack + Wazuh (SIEM):** A comprehensive Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. The ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is combined with Wazuh to provide powerful log analysis, threat detection, and security monitoring capabilities across the lab environment.

- **Wireshark (Network Monitoring):** A network protocol analyzer used for monitoring and analyzing network traffic in real-time, essential for identifying suspicious activities and potential threats.

- **Suricata (IDS/IPS):** An open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that performs deep packet inspection, network security monitoring, and real-time threat detection.

- **Kali Linux:** A specialized Linux distribution equipped with a vast array of penetration testing tools. Kali Linux is used to conduct various security assessments, including vulnerability scanning, network attacks, and exploitation of the Metasploitable VM.

### Project Objectives:

- **Security Monitoring:** Implement and configure a SIEM (ELK + Wazuh) to collect, analyze, and visualize security data from various sources within the lab.

- **Threat Detection:** Utilize Suricata and Wireshark to detect and analyze potential threats, including network-based attacks and intrusion attempts.

- **Penetration Testing:** Conduct comprehensive penetration testing exercises using Kali Linux, targeting the Metasploitable VM to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

- **Incident Response:** Develop and practice incident response strategies based on detected threats and simulated attacks within the lab environment.
