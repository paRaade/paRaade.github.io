## Vulnerability Discussion

Inadequate log size will cause the log to fill up quickly. This may prevent audit events from being recorded properly and require frequent attention by administrative personnel. 

## Compliance Check
If the system is configured to send audit records directly to an audit server, this is NA. This must be documented with the ISSO.

If the following registry value does not exist or is not configured as specified, this is a finding:

- Registry Hive: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`
- Registry Path: `\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog\Application\`
- Value Name: `MaxSize`
- Value Type: `REG_DWORD`
- Value: `0x00008000` (32768) (or greater) 

## Remediation
If the system is configured to send audit records directly to an audit server, this is NA. This must be documented with the ISSO.

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> Windows Components >> Event Log Service >> Application >> "Specify the maximum log file size (KB)" to "Enabled" with a "Maximum Log Size (KB)" of "32768" or greater.

```
# Check for administrative privileges

    Write-Error "This script requires administrative privileges. Please run PowerShell as an administrator."
    exit
}

# Define the registry path and values
$RegistryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog\Application"
$ValueName = "MaxSize"
$ValueData = 32768  # 32,768 KB (or greater)

# Ensure the registry path exists
if (-not (Test-Path $RegistryPath)) {
    Write-Output "Registry path does not exist. Creating path: $RegistryPath"
    New-Item -Path $RegistryPath -Force | Out-Null
}

# Set the registry value
Write-Output "Configuring Application event log size to $ValueData KB..."
Set-ItemProperty -Path $RegistryPath -Name $ValueName -Value $ValueData -Force

# Verify the registry value
$ConfiguredValue = (Get-ItemProperty -Path $RegistryPath -Name $ValueName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).$ValueName
if ($ConfiguredValue -ge $ValueData) {
    Write-Output "Verification successful: Application event log size is set to $ConfiguredValue KB."
} else {
    Write-Error "Verification failed: Application event log size is not configured as expected."
}
