# Red Team Infrastructure Development and Automation

### Description:

In this project, I developed a comprehensive and OPSEC-safe red team infrastructure designed for internal and external operations. This infrastructure supports advanced attack scenarios by leveraging both cloud and on-premise services to ensure adaptability and stealth.
This project demonstrates my ability to engineer and deploy secure, resilient, and scalable infrastructure for red team operations, ensuring operational security (OPSEC) while executing advanced attack scenarios.


- **Command and Control (C2) Setup**: Configured a robust C2 framework to manage and control red team operations.
- **Cloud-Based Redirectors**: Utilized AWS CloudFront Service and Microsoft Azure Front Door & CDN profiles as redirectors to mask and manage traffic efficiently.
- **Automated Nginx Setup**: Implemented an automated Nginx configuration process, including conditional redirects, to enhance operational security and flexibility.
- **Payload Server with Pwndrop**: Deployed a payload delivery server using Pwndrop, enabling secure and reliable distribution of payloads.
- **Phishing Infrastructure**: Created a sophisticated phishing infrastructure using Evilginx and Gophish, specifically designed for bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA) defenses.
